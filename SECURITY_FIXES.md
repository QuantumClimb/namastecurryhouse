# Security Fixes - October 30, 2025

## Summary
Fixed all security vulnerabilities identified in npm audit.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. ✅ vite (Moderate Severity)
- **Issue**: vite allows server.fs.deny bypass via backslash on Windows
- **Advisory**: GHSA-93m4-6634-74q7
- **Affected Version**: 7.1.0 - 7.1.10
- **Fix Applied**: Updated vite from 7.1.9 to 7.1.12
- **Method**: `npm audit fix --force`

### 2. ✅ xlsx (High Severity)
- **Issues**: 
  - Prototype Pollution in sheetJS (GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6)
  - SheetJS Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9)
- **Affected Version**: < 0.19.3 and < 0.20.2
- **Fix Applied**: Removed xlsx package entirely
- **Reason**: Package was not being used in codebase (no imports found)
- **Method**: `npm uninstall xlsx`

## Verification

```bash
# Before fixes
npm audit
# 2 vulnerabilities found (1 moderate, 1 high)

# After fixes
npm audit
# found 0 vulnerabilities ✅
```

## Build Verification
- ✅ `npm run build` successful
- ✅ Application functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced

## Notes
- The xlsx package was originally included for potential Excel file parsing but was never implemented
- If Excel functionality is needed in the future, consider using alternatives like:
  - `exceljs` (more secure, actively maintained)
  - `xlsx-populate` (focused on keeping existing workbook features)
  - `better-xlsx` (improved API)

## Node.js Version Notice
Current Node.js version (20.18.3) is slightly below vite's recommended version (20.19+ or 22.12+). Consider upgrading Node.js for optimal performance, though current version still works.
